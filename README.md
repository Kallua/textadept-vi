textadept-vi
============

Customisation for the textadept editor to make it a bit more like vim.

This currently experimental, to see if it's feasible to carry my vim habits
over to a more easily scriptable editor, rather than attempting to fully
implement vim.

It's very much incomplete, with parts implemented on demand as I have time.
